# TODO: Fix PWA Workbox glob pattern warning

- [ ] Analyze the PWA/Workbox configuration (vite.config.ts or workbox config)
- [ ] Check the contents of frontend/dev-dist for expected files
- [ ] Ensure the build process outputs files to dev-dist before PWA step
- [ ] Update glob pattern or build process to resolve the warning
- [ ] Test the PWA build to confirm the warning is gone
